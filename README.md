# Fall-24-Introduction-to-MATLAB

This workshop is taught by Ram Krishnamurthy (Senior Education Application Engineer, MathWorks). 
Ram assists faculty, researchers, and students in doing their best work by collaborating with them on curriculum and research matters. He received his Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2016. His expertise is in the applications of Artificial Intelligence techniques for Image and Signal workflows.

In this session, you will learn how MATLAB can be used to visualize and analyze data, perform numerical computations, and develop algorithms. Through live demonstrations and examples, you will see how MATLAB can help you become more effective in your work.
Highlights include:
  1. Accessing data from many sources (files, other software, hardware, etc.)
  2. Using interactive tools for iterative exploration, design, and problem solving
  3. Automating and capturing your work in easy-to-write scripts and programs
  4. Building and deploying interactive applications
